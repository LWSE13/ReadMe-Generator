# ReadMe Generator 

## Description
I created this project to get some practice on a few things, those being node.js, switch statements, tertary operators and a further understanding  of template literals. This project solves the monotonous task of having to refigure out what sections you would like to use in your readme and setting those sections up in markdown. In the future I would like to add more automation, specifically to this description section in which inquirer will ask you questions and be able to fill the start of paragraphs for example it will ask "what are your motivations" and begin your description paragraph with "my motivations were".
